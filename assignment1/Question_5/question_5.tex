There are 4982 Applications with an average throughput time of 21.904 as determined using the following Process:\\

Using Celonis Process AI on our Dataset we learn that the most frequent variant (happy path) happens 320 times. This variant can be seen below.\\

The following graph shows the frequency distribution of the throughput times. As one can see they are initially quite high and eventually deteriorate in frequency until the 29-33 Day, where they spike again and after that deteriorate quickly again. The reason for the spike at 29-33 Days is probably that a new month begins/ends at this time. Therefore many applications will likely be terminated at this time for administrative reasons.\\
