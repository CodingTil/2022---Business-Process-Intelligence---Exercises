\subsection*{(a)}
There are 4982 Applications with an average throughput time of 21.904 as determined using the following Process:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/QUESTION_5a_PROCESS_average_throughput_time.png}

Using Celonis Process AI on our Dataset we learn that the most frequent variant (happy path) happens 320 times. This variant can be seen below.\\

The following graph shows the frequency distribution of the throughput times. As one can see they are initially quite high and eventually deteriorate in frequency until the 29-33 Day, where they spike again and after that deteriorate quickly again. The reason for the spike at 29-33 Days is probably that a new month begins/ends at this time. Therefore, many applications will likely be terminated at this time for administrative reasons.\\

\subsection*{(b)}
% First item
The BPMN model for cases running under 30 days can be seen below (zoom in to inspect in detail). We created it by starting a new Analysis and opening a new \textit{conformance} sheet. Then we clicked \textit{Mine process model} and in the next window added a new selection for Throughput time under 30. Then we clicked \textit{select all} and \textit{Launch analysis}. We then clicked \textit{View process model} where the model below was displayed and downloadable.\\

% Third item
The DFG below was created by opening a new process explorer and only selecting the following activities to display: A$\_$Create $\_$Application, O$\_$Created, W$\_$Complete$\_$Application, O$\_$Accepted, O$\_$Refused, O$\_$Cancelled and A$\_$Cancelled. 100\% of activities and connections are being displayed. To see which edges are especially long-lasting we selected throughput time as our edge label.\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/QUESTION_5b_DFG.png}
This way we can see that there are two very long-lasting edges (\texttt{O$\_$Created$\rightarrow$A$\_$Cancelled} and \texttt{W$\_$Complete$\_$application$\rightarrow$A$\_$Cancelled}) with a throughput time of 27 days. There is also a number of medium long-lasting edges with throughput times of 13-15 days

% Fourth item
The DFG below was created by opening a new process explorer and only selecting the following activities to display: A$\_$Create $\_$Application, O$\_$Created, W$\_$Complete$\_$Application, O$\_$Accepted, O$\_$Refused, O$\_$Cancelled and A$\_$Cancelled. 100\% of activities and connections are being displayed. We also filtered the dataset to only select cases with a throughput over 29 days.
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/QUESTION_5b_over30.png}
Here we can see, that most cases with a throughput time over 29 days were cancelled. Additionally, most were passed through A$\_$Cancelled first, before passing through O$\_$Cancelled to the Process End.

\subsection*{(c)}
We open a new Process Overview for our Process in Celonis just like we did in a). To exclude all cancelled applications we add a new selection of type \textit{Attribute selection}. Since per definition cancelled applications are those that contain the activity \textit{A$\_$cancelled} we exclude all the applications containing it by selecting \texttt{Activity$\_$table$\_$csv > ACTIVITY > A$\_$Cancelled} and click \textit{Invert selection}. We also create a new throughput time selection for applications with a throughput time between 30 and infinity to only see long-running cases. The resulting Process Overview can be seen below.\\

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/QUESTION_5c_process_overview_happy_path.png}
From it, we learn that there are 1792 long-running applications that weren't cancelled.
